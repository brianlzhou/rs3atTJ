# üõëÔ∏è Course Guidelines

## üìù Grading
Assignments will be graded, and grades will be posted in SIS within 7 school days after the due
date with the understanding that major projects/papers may require additional time to ensure
quality feedback. SIS is the gradebook of record. Students taking the RS2 course in the fall will
take the AP exam in May of the spring semester.

### Gradebook
Grades are calculated using a rolling (continuous) gradebook and will be recorded as points and converted to percentages and then to letters for report card grades by dividing the number of points earned by the number of points possible. The Fairfax County grading scale is:
A (92.5-100) = 4.0 B+ (86.5-89.4) = 3.3 C+ (76.5-79.4) = 2.3 D+ (66.5-69.4) = 1.3
A- (89.5-92.4) = 3.7 B (82.5-86.4) = 3.0 C (72.5-76.4) = 2.0 D (63.5-66.4) = 1.0
B- (79.5-82.4) = 2.7 C- (69.5-72.4) = 1.7 F (below 63.5) = 0.0

Grades will be rounded using standard mathematical rounding convention. For example, 92.5 would round up to an A, while a grade of 92.49 would remain an A-. This class will use a rolling gradebook and total points. No one assignment will greatly impact the overall grade in the course. Grades for individual assignments will be available through Schoology and SIS.

### Quarter Grades:
The quarter grade will be determined by the percentage of points earned out of points assigned. Some example assignments include, reading quizzes, group practice, individual practice, progress checks, and summative assessments.

 - No one assignment or assessment will count for more than 30% of the total quarter grade.
 - Homework is limited to no more than 10% of the total quarter grade
 - Per grading and reporting, there will be at a minimum 9 grades per quarter.
 
### Final Grades:
The end-of-course grade will be based on a rolling gradebook for daily assignments, which will
be worth 80% of the overall grade for the course. The final exam/project will be worth 20% of
the overall grade for the course

## üì§ Assignments:

### Homework:
Many activities including group work will be completed during class time. Each day there will be a short individual assignment that needs to be completed on your own. This is due the class period after it is assigned. 

### Late Work:
Due to the way content knowledge builds from day to day in statistics, it is important to complete all assignments on time. Late work will be accepted for half credit if turned in one day late, otherwise no credit will be given. Please contact your teacher in advance to make arrangements if you know you will be absent and not be able to submit work or take an assessment on time.

### Retakes/Revision:
Currently we will not be administering large unit tests that are worth 100 points. If this were to change, students who scored less than 80% on a test would be eligible for one score improvement per quarter. This improvement would be based on a retest. Your replacement grade for the test is equal to the higher grade you received (either your original test score or retest score), but in no event is the replacement grade to exceed 80%. To be eligible, you must complete and turn in test corrections for the test within one week of when the test is returned to the class.

:::{.callout-note}
Score improvement does not apply to quizzes, progress checks, cumulative exams, and final exams. Cumulative Tests may be administered at the end of Units 3 and 6 (if we have proctoring software). Any cumulative assessments given are part of the quarter grade, not the final exam grade.

### Final Exam:
There will be an end-of-course project that will be the final exam. More details and supporting
documents will be available after the AP exams are completed.

### Makeup Policy
If you know you will be absent, please contact your teacher to plan for making-up work. If you unexpectedly miss class, contact your teacher and your group members to plan to complete missed content. If you are absent for one day, you will have a day to submit make-up work. If you need to be absent for an extended amount of time, please contact your teacher to come up with a plan for submitting makeup work.
